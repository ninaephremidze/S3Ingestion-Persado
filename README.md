How it works
This code works by setting up a Lambda with an S3 file creation as its trigger. This Lambda then starts up a new EC2 instance using a saved AMI, copies script and data files to that EC2 instance, runs the script on the files, and terminates the instance. The scripts in this case convert the incoming CSV file into API requests that hit our Track and/or Identify APIs

Setup
Step 1: Create IAM roles
In this step we'll be setting up 2 IAM roles, one for the Lambda and one for the EC2.

1a) EC2 IAM role
Navigate to IAM > Roles and click "Create role"
Select AWS service for the trusted entity and EC2 for the use-case, then click Next
Select the following policy names and click Next
AmazonEC2FullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
AmazonSSMFullAccess
Click Next
Set the role name to klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-ec2-role and click Create role
1b) Lambda IAM role
Navigate to IAM > Roles and click "Create role"
Select AWS service for the trusted entity and Lambda for the use-case, then click Next
Click Creat policy, click JSON, and paste the following, then click Next
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Click Next
Set the Name to PassRole and click Create policy
Select the following policy names and click Next
AmazonEC2FullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess
AmazonSSMFullAccess
AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
PassRole (the one we just created)
Click Next
Set the role name to klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-lambda-role and click Create role
Step 2: Create the AMI
This part of the setup will create the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) which will be used as the disk image for the EC2 when the Lambda starts it. It will need to contain all of the components the code needs to use so we don't run into any errors.

Navigate to the EC2 Instances dashboard and click Launch Instances
Select the 64-bit (x86) option for the most recent Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type image
Select t2.micro (the free tier eligible one) and click Review and Launch
Click Launch
Select Proceed without key pair and click Launch Instances
Navigate back to the EC2 Instances dashboard and wait until the new instance appears with a name of - in the Instance state Running (this may take 1-2 minutes and you may need to refresh the instance list to see it appear)
Right click on the new instance you created and click Connect
Change the User name to root and click Connect
Run the following commands (note: in the last line, make sure to replace both occurrences of region with the region in which you made this EC2, more info here):
pip3 install requests
pip3 install urllib3
pip3 install boto3
sudo yum install -y https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-region/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm

Navigate back to the EC2 Instances dashboard
Right click on the EC2 instance and click Images and template > Craete image
Enter the name klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-ami and click Create Image
You'll see a success message at the top of the window, click on the AMI ID (starts with ami-)
Copy the AMI ID of this image for later
Once the Status for this AMI reads available, it is safe to delete the EC2 we created earlier (note: this may take a few minutes so feel free to continue the rest of the steps first and delete the old EC2 at the end).
Step 3: Set up S3
The S3 bucket is the component of this setup which stores the script files for processing/sending CSVs as API calls, the CSVs themselves, and any log files generated as a result of the CSV processing.

3a) Update the S3 config.py file
This config file is what controls the mapping of your CSV to API payloads as well as some other parameters described below. Open up the config.py file located in the folder s3-files/scripts/ and follow the directions below to update it.

The S3 config file contains a few options:

public_api_key: the 6 character public API key from your Klaviyo account

s3_bucket_name: the name of the bucket where the scripts, data files (CSVs), and logs are/will be located (note: you shouldn't need to edit this if you followed the naming schemes in this guide)

s3_logs_folder: the name of the directory to which logs will be sent on the S3 (note: you shouldn't need to edit this if you followed the naming schemes in this guide)

working_dir: the working directory where code will be run on the EC2 (note: you shouldn't need to edit this but make sure this matches the corresponding variable in the Lambda config if you do edit it)

event_name: if this CSV importer is being used to generate an event, this is where you name that event

event_mapping: if this CSV importer is being used to generate an event, this is where you set up the property mapping (described below)

profile_mapping: if this CSV importer is only being used to send profile properties, this is where you set up the property mapping (described below)

Mappings
Mappings are entirely case-sensitive and have the following properties: Mapping Fields

column_header: (required) the title of the column header where we should look for this field's value

data_type_override: (optional) defaults to "string", required if the field is to be interpreted as not a string. Available options include:

number: a numeric value (if the value contains non-numeric characters like currency symbols, it will be interpreted as a string)
boolean: a case-insensitive value that can be "truthy" or "falsy". Accepted values include:
True values: 1, "1", True, "true", "t", "yes", "y"
False values: 0, "0", False, "false", "f", "no", "n"
date: a value that can be resolved as a date/time with a given format (see data_type_details)
data_type_details: (optional, required based on "data_type_override"), provides details on how to read the data type. Available options include:

If the data_type_override is set to date, use a string composed of Python strftime codes to represent the format of the date/time in the CSV file
A property mapping is set up like the following structure:

"NameOfProfileProperty": {
  "column_header": "Column Header",
  "data_type_override": "the type of the data used if not a string",
  "data_type_details": "something specific to this data type's formatting"
}
As an example, let's say you want to track a property called "SignupDate" to a profile or event. In the CSV, this field is a date with the format "2021-04-25 10:35:01". Given this, you would use the following mapping:

"SignupDate": {
  "column_header": "Signup Date",
  "data_type_override": "date",
  "data_type_details": "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
}
3b) Create the S3 bucket and add the files
Navigate to S3 and create a bucket called klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-bucket
Enter this bucket and drag the contents of the s3-files/ folder into the bucket to import them
Step 4: Set up Lambda
The Lambda is the component of this setup used to start up the EC2 responsible for running the sync code whenever a CSV file appears.

4a) Create the Lambda
Create a new Lambda function
Set the name to klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion
Set the Runtime language to Python 3.9
Click "Change the default execution role"
Select "Use an existing role"
Select the Lambda role created in Step 1, klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-lambda-role
4b) Copy the code
Create files in the Lambda matching the names of the files in this package's lambda-files/ folder.

Note: You should already have lambda_function.py so you should only need to create config.py and utils.py.

Copy and paste the contents of each file in the lambda-files/ folder into their respectively named file on klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion in AWS

4c) Update the Lambda config.py file
The Lambda config.py file (in lambda-files/) consists of settings related to AWS services. This file contains sections for:

EC2 field setup: parameters needed for the EC2 that the Lambda will start in order to process the CSV

ec2_name: the name/label you want this EC2 instance to have
ec2_region: the region in which this EC2 should be started
ami_image_id: the AMI ID of the image set up in Step 2
iam_instance_profile_name: the name of the EC2 role set up in Step 1 (ie. "klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-ec2-role")
working_dir: the working directory where code will be run on the EC2 (note: you shouldn't need to edit this but make sure this matches the corresponding variable in the S3 config if you do edit it)
S3 field setup:

s3_base_folder = the root directory of the s3 bucket, takes the form of s3://NAME_OF_BUCKET (note: you shouldn't need to edit this if you followed the naming schemes in this guide)
s3_scripts_folder = the S3 folder in which logs are stored (note: you shouldn't need to edit this if you followed the naming schemes in this guide)
s3_data_folder = the S3 folder to which data (the CSVs) will be sent/uploaded/imported (note: you shouldn't need to edit this if you followed the naming schemes in this guide)
s3_data_file = case-sensitive name of the CSV file to be processed (note: make sure this name is always the same on all CSVs you upload)
SSM command setup field setup:

These are the list of commands sent to the EC2 by SSM, these should be left unchanged.
4d) Update the Lambda settings
Update the Trigger settings

Click Add trigger near the top of the Lambda
Select S3 from the dropdown
Select the name of the bucket you created in Step 3 as the Bucket (ie. klaviyo-s3-triggered-csv-ingestion-bucket)
Select All object create events as the Event type
Enter data/ as the Prefix
Accept the acknowledgement and click Add
Update the Configuration settings

Above the code-editing section, select the Configuration tab
Click on General configuration
Click Edit
Under Description, add: Klaviyo S3 Triggered CSV Ingestion
Under Timeout, set the minutes to 15 and the seconds to 0
Click Save
